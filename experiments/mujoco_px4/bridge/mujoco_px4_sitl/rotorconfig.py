"""Sidecar rotor block -> :class:`RotorModel`.

The conversion sidecar (MODELING_CONVENTIONS.md section 6) is the one place a
platform's measured motor numbers are written down. Two consumers read it:
``scripts/urdf_to_mjcf.py`` at conversion time, and this module at startup, via
``--rotors`` / ``MUJOCO_SITL_ROTORS``. **They share one parser**, which is why
:class:`RotorSpec` lives here rather than in the script -- a second parser for
the same file is how the two drift apart, and the drift is silent: a model whose
rotor count matches still flies, with the wrong thrust.

:func:`load_rotors` reads **only** the runtime fields -- ``rotors[]`` and
``omega_idle``. It deliberately does not touch ``urdf``, ``output`` or
``mesh_dir``, so flying does not depend on the CAD export being present. The
STLs are 7 MB of private geometry; the eight numbers needed to fly are not.

    """One rotor: where thrust is applied, and its coefficients.

    ``pos`` is FLU, in ``base_link``'s frame, and the *index is PX4's* --
    ``HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS.controls[i]`` drives ``rotor{i}``, so this list's
    order must match ``CA_ROTOR*`` in the airframe file up to the FLU/FRD
    y-sign. Getting it wrong presents as yaw drift or attitude cross-coupling
    and is routinely misdiagnosed as an EKF fault.

    ``pz`` (the site's z) produces no torque: thrust is along body +z, so
    ``r x [0,0,T]`` uses only x and y. A coaxial deck's height contributes no
    torque, in our model and in PX4's allocator alike (section 4). It does
    place the propeller disc, so it should be the blade plane.

    ``radius`` is the propeller's, in metres. The conversion draws it as the
    rotor site's disc, which is what the simulator's propeller clearance check
    reads (``arm.PropellerMonitor``). Geometry, like ``pos``: it reaches the
    simulator through the generated MJCF, not through ``--rotors``.

    ``ct_factor`` scales ``c_t`` for aerodynamic interference, the coaxial
    lower deck's discount (MODELING_CONVENTIONS.md section 5). It reaches the
    plant only: ``c_t`` stays the datasheet's isolated-rotor fit, and that is
    what the PX4 airframe's ``CA_ROTOR*_CT`` carries (the airframe template
    says why).
