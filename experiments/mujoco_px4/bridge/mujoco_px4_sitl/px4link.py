"""PX4's API link, used the way a companion computer uses it, on simulated time.

The in-process research controller (:mod:`control`) takes the vehicle's state
from here, not from MuJoCo: EKF2's ``vehicle_odometry`` in the MAVLink
``ODOMETRY`` message on PX4's API/offboard link (UDP 14540 + instance,
``px4-rc.mavlink``). Its setpoints and commands go back the same way. Same
messages, same link, as a controller on the real vehicle's companion computer.

**What makes it deterministic is PX4's receive thread** (plan 3.9). It runs on
wall clock, handles a datagram's messages in order and each to completion, and
answers ``PING`` from the same thread. So a ``PING`` at the end of a datagram,
once echoed, proves everything before it is in uORB -- a **barrier** that works
while PX4's clock is held between our frames. :meth:`ApiLink.send` uses one, and
:meth:`ApiLink.fetch` asks for EKF2's newest output behind one, after every
frame PX4 has answered.

Two things would break that, and are kept off the barrier path:

* **Requests that end in ``configure_stream_threadsafe()``** block the receive
  thread on simulated time, so a barrier behind one never echoes while the clock
  is held. :func:`check_barrier_safe` refuses them. The one this link needs,
  silencing the periodic ``ODOMETRY`` stream, is sent before the first barrier,
  while frames advance without barriers, between two PINGs: barriers start
  once PX4 has acknowledged it and echoed the second, which shows the request
  has left the receive thread. The first makes PX4 register our component
  before handling the request; PX4 sends a ``COMMAND_ACK`` only to a component
  it has seen, and registers one only after handling its message
  (``mavlink_main.cpp:2693``, ``mavlink_receiver.cpp:3244-3249``), so an ACK to
  the very first message can be dropped.
* **The periodic stream races the estimator**: it sends whatever is newest when
  PX4's main thread wakes. Given an interval of 2e9 us it never sends on its
  own, and ``REQUEST_MESSAGE`` then sends only a new output. Not -1: that
  deletes the stream, and the next request would re-create it through the
  blocking path.

**Ages are exact.** ``ODOMETRY.time_usec`` is EKF2's IMU sample time on PX4's
clock, and under lockstep PX4's clock *is* ours -- ``hrt_absolute_time()``
returns the time our last ``HIL_SENSOR`` set (``drv_hrt.cpp:106-110``).

The positions are in EKF2's own local frame, whose datum it picks from GNSS; the
simulator's ground truth uses the configured home. :attr:`ApiLink.origin`
carries EKF2's datum so the two can be compared (:func:`frames.rebase_ned`).
