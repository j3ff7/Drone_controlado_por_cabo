"""Lockstep orchestration: strict lockstep, and the plan section 3.2 fallback.

**Once PX4 has answered, every frame waits for the answer stamped with its
time.** The frame ``[t_k, t_k+1)`` is driven by PX4's answer to the
``HIL_SENSOR`` stamped ``t_k-1``, so IMU -> actuator is exactly one frame, and
``HIL_SENSOR(t_k+1)`` is not sent before the answer stamped ``t_k`` has arrived.
The stamp is PX4's clock when it sent the answer, which only our ``HIL_SENSOR``
moves, so with no frame outstanding it proves which frame the answer was
computed from (plan 3.2, "What an answer proves"). The one exception is the
frame the first answer arrives in: the fallback frame before it waited on
nothing, so it runs on that answer at whatever age it arrived (plan 3.2).

**Before PX4's first answer, and after a frame whose answer timed out, the
bounded-lead loop runs**: wall clock paces it, and the actuator stream only
bounds how far ahead of PX4 it may get. Both halves are mandatory there:

* Without the pacer, nothing bounds us during PX4's boot -- which happens
  entirely inside this loop's first frames, because ``simulator_mavlink start``
  blocks ``rcS`` until our first ``HIL_SENSOR``. Running ahead drops IMU FIFO
  samples and presents as estimator divergence.
* Without the brake, a PX4 that fell behind is outrun the same way.
* Blocking on ``HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS`` *from the first frame* deadlocks at
  startup: PX4 publishes none before Commander is up, and its escape hatches are
  either measured in simulated time or compiled out under lockstep.

Every timeout here is **wall clock**, and none is fatal. A frame whose answer
timed out is counted as unproven, never silently.
